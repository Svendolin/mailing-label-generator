[ðŸ’¯] 2nd Note: The described OOP / MVC / PDO processes are not summarized in the PDF but directly here in the readme.md markdown:


Ettikator, the mailing labels generator should contain:

* Used OOP and PDO, MVC principle and asynchronal requests via AJAX
* A database that contains all relevant data (e.g. user data, articles, page content, etc.).
* Two seperate Layouts or functionabiulities for unregistred as well as registred users
* A login form that registered users can use to log in. Once a user is logged in, they should be able to edit data in the database in an ASYNCHRONAL WAY and SERVERSIDE CONTENT
* A registration form that unregistered users can use to log in. This form should require at least four fields to be filled in and validated correctly (e.g. username, password,
E- mail address, last name, first name, etc.).
* Implementing a safe datatransfer and prepared statements.

Optional stuff:

* "Forgot Password"
* E-Mail validation with your fitting email of your registered accounnt
* Search function
* Chatbot
* App with a full MVC-Model


MUST ADD for alerts for future processes:

## Label-Generator (Explenation) ðŸ’¬
***

Me and my mother run and host a web shop together and print out the labels myself, either directly at the post office (official website for online packaging) or with a "postal parcel addresser". So far we have used an outdated site: 
https://ignaz.ch/paket/ettikette/index.php - The idea now is to set it up like this, but with a login system where you can save the addresses and choose from a few designs. There are comparatively few good sites that fit this bill: so this project is THE ultimate chance for a massive improvement!

Quick overview what I've integrated in our project:

- The user can register and log in. Error messages are displayed on the server side via php (Registration / Login). All other messages should pop up on the client side via "Sweet Alert"!

- Once the user is logged in, he can keep his own address book and store addresses in his database

- When logged in, the user can access the GOOGLE MAPS API and GOOGLE MAPS GEOLOCATION (browse through the map or search addresses) asynchronously.

- CRUD statements are there to delete and edit addresses if necessary

- PHP is built in the OOP / MVC model and is clearly cast in sub- and superclasses and not procedural

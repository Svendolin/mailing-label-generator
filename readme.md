Ettikator, the mailing labels generator should contain:

## Label-Generator (Explenation) ðŸ’¬
***

Me and my mother run and host a web shop together and print out the labels myself, either directly at the post office (official website for online packaging) or with a "postal parcel addresser". So far we have used an outdated site: 
https://ignaz.ch/paket/ettikette/index.php - The idea now is to set it up like this, but with a login system where you can save the addresses and choose from a few designs. There are comparatively few good sites that fit this bill: so this project is THE ultimate chance for a massive improvement!



<br />
<br />

***
## Site explanation: â˜‘
***

HOME (index.php):

* Overview of events, news about the owner's vehicle and featured blogposts where the latest and most popular posts are loaded.
* ``IMPORTANT: (Password / Username / Email of the regstered users are stored at .gitignore)``

<br />
<br />



***
## Database Design (Explenation) ðŸ’¬
***

Each user should provide the following information via registration form in order to register:
- Surename and Familyname
- Username (Shown in Blogposts, as well as publishing date)
- Vehicle (Car Brand, Model, Year)
- Image of the vehicle
- Place of residence (Canton only)
- Email address 
- Password
- Password Repeat

(Users can write and edit blogs while they are registrated and logged in)

(Users can watch blogs while they aren't registrated and also logged out)

(Admin should be able to edit and delete blog posts)

(Admin should be able delete users)
